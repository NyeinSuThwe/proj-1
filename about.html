        My Melody is a white rabbit born in the Forest of Mariland on January 18th. She is known for her kindness,
        thoughtfulness, and love of baking. Her most treasured possession is her pink hood, a gift made by her grandmother.

        Although small and simple in appearance, she represents friendship, warmth, and the joy found in everyday
        activities like sharing food and spending time with loved ones.
