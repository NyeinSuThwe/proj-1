      <p>
        This post is a quick reflection on how I built a My Melody–inspired website using only HTML. 
        No CSS, no JavaScript—just headings, sections, and good alt text. That constraint pushed me to think about
        content first: what belongs on the page, in what order, and why it matters to a visitor who just wants to read.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started with landmarks (<code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>footer</code>) so screen
        readers and keyboard users get a clear map. From there, I used one <code>h1</code> per page and stepped down with
        <code>h2</code>/<code>h3</code> to show hierarchy. Each image has a purpose and an <code>alt</code> that explains the idea
        (not just the file name). Even without colors or fonts, that structure makes the page feel calm—kind of like My Melody’s
        friendly, gentle vibe.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing the copy in my own voice helped too. Instead of chasing fancy layout tricks, I focused on the message:
        a short welcome, a featured image with a caption, and three small “project” teasers that I can expand later.
        It’s simple on purpose. If someone can understand the site with styles turned off, I’ve done my job.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part of the theme is that it reminds me to be kind to readers: short paragraphs, meaningful link text,
        and clear section titles. If I add styling in the future, it’ll be the cherry on top—not the thing holding the
        content together.
